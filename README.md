This project utilizes the YOLO-World architecture, a variation of the YOLO model, to automate video annotation. YOLO-World processes video frames to detect and annotate objects with bounding boxes and labels. To improve performance, smaller objects occupying less than 10% of the frame area are filtered out during the annotation process.
